                     <p>It all started with a little experiment in 8th grade. In our classroom, there was a long bulletin board which students took turns to decorate. When it was my turn, I wanted to create not only a decorative piece but something fun and useful. At the age of 12, one of the most exciting activities is to receive “secret messages" scribbled on scrap paper.</p>
                     <p>Based on this idea, I sketched a blueprint for a wall of cardboard mailboxes. With the help of my classmates, we turned the sketch into reality. While the design is not perfect, it ignited my passion to create products that encourage interaction and better understanding among people.</p>

            <p class="heading">When skills + passion turn into profession</p>
            <p>When I was an undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant to my linguistic professor. My job included conducting interviews and analyzing how speech patterns convey cultural identities. In the interviews, I learned to situate myself in each interviewee’s role to understand how they respond to their situations. It was where I first realized the importance of empathy in conducting user-oriented research.</p>
            <p>I completed my tertiary education with an M.A. in Philosophy focusing on topics related to the philosophy of mind. I am often curious about how we human beings associate what we have in mind with things we find in reality. This training in creative and logical thinking is crucial in the design process. It has guided me to find an effective approach to solving a design problem within the scope/ the constraint of the project.</p>
            <p>My interest in creating tech-related solutions has brought me along a path of coding and research in online adaptive learning. But to put my skills into practice, I pursued a UX Design Apprenticeship at Bloc. The program has strengthened my knowledge of visual and interactive design for web and mobile products. In design critiques, I learned to be aware of the limitations of my assumptions and to always ask for feedback from users and designers.</p>
            <p>To me, there does not exist an everlasting “good” design. Every design must evolve with the need of its users. This is also what keeps me learning and sharpening my skills.</p>
            <p>In my leisure time, I like to read, <a id ="art" href="fun.html">create artwork</a>, push my limits through workouts, and watch BBC Earth.</p>
